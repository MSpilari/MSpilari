# Hello, welcome! üëã

My name is Matheus Bernardes Spilari and this is my github. :octocat:

Since I was a child I have always been very curious and I liked to take things apart, one of the first ones was a CD player on an old computer.:floppy_disk:
The funniest part is that I took them apart because I wanted to know how they worked, what happened in there when the part was turned on and that way I broke some of my family's computer parts and even some of my toys. :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

Today the curiosity continues, but the part about breaking things doesn't (my bank account thanks). This is what you will see here on my Github. I try to turn it into a great laboratory, MY LABORATORY :telescope:, where I test new technologies, trying to understand how they work, making some analogies. But I also use it as my portfolio to show my learning and my codes.
